Nodejs, Jquery, Postgres, Express application hosted on Heroku

The purpose of this application is to provide a means of generating analytics and visualization of the
chess games I play on lichess.org. 

Currently, I do a REST call to get my lastest game, store that game in Postgres, and finally display that game with PgnViewerJS.
